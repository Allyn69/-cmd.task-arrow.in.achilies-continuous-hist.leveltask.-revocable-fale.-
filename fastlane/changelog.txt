HOTFIX:
- Passing arguments to #! scripts like youtube-dl didn't work
- youtube-dl was 50% slower than it used to be
- There is now extra debugging code so I can fix that weird crash when doing things like apk upgrade
Release notes for previous build are included below.

New stuff:
- Beta quality read/write Files app support
- File locking
- Forking and exiting is now 10x faster
- Probably more that I missed

Bug fixes
- Error when running a program with more than 256 arguments
- `RLIM_INFINITY` on `RLIMIT_NOFILE` being interpreted as -1
- Zero bytes on a terminal being interpreted as newlines
- Crash when running dmesg and the log buffer is too big
- Various problems with pty semantics, to get zpty working better
- lld showing incorrect output
- Very serious problems caused by renaming directories
- Crash when dealing with a path such as /../..
